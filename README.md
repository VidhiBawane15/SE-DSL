#Practical 1: library=>
Write a Python program to manage the borrowing records of books in a library. Implementthe following functionalities:
• Compute the average number of books borrowed by all library members.
• Find the book with the highest and lowest number of borrowings in the library.
• Count the number of members who have not borrowed any books (denoted by a borrow count of 0).
• Display the most frequently borrowed book (i.e., the mode of borrow counts).

#Practical 2: search=>
In an e-commerce system, customer account IDs are stored in a list, and you are tasked with writing a program that implements the following:
• Linear Search: Check if a particular customer account ID exists in the list.
• Binary Search: Implement Binary search to find if a customer account ID exists,improving the search efficiency over the basic linear

#Practical 3: stack=>
Implementing a real-time undo/redo system for a text editing application using a Stack datastructure. The system should support the following operations:
• Make a Change: A new change to the document is made.
• Undo Action: Revert the most recent change and store it for potential redo.
• Redo Action: Reapply the most recently undone action.
• Display Document State: Show the current state of the document after undoing or redoing an action

#Practical 4: queueu=>
Implement a real-time event processing system using a Queue data structure. The system should support the following features:
• Add an Event: When a new event occurs, it should be added to the event queue.
• Process the Next Event: The system should process and remove the event that has been in the queue the longest.
• Display Pending Events: Show all the events currently waiting to be processed.
• Cancel an Event: An event can be canceled if it has not been processed.

#Practical 5:Hashing=>
Implement a hash table of size 10 and use the division method as a hash function. 
In case of a collision, use chaining. Implement the following operations:
• Insert(key): Insert key-value pairs into the hash table. 
• Search(key): Search for the value associated with a given key.
• Delete(key): Delete a key-value pair from the hash table

#Practical 6=> BFS
Consider a particular area in your city. Note the popular locations A, B, C . . . in that area.
Assume these locations represent nodes of a graph. If there is a route between two locations,
it is represented as connections between nodes. Find out the sequence in which you will
visit these locations, starting from (say A) using (i) BFS and (ii) DFS. Represent a given
graph using an adjacency matrix to perform DFS and an adjacency list to perform BFS
